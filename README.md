# Space Invaders
---
#### This repository contains my simple Space Invaders game remake, with a modern twist, built in Python using Pygame. Space Invaders is a popular 70s retro arcade with the main goal being to defend yourself as a ship shooting lasers to stop the aliens gradually getting closer trying to defeat you. Challenge yourself by playing to defend earth and yourself from a wave of aliens.
#### The game has features such as player movement, map borders, mystery ships, high score saving systems and a pack of aliens moving down the screen gradually.
